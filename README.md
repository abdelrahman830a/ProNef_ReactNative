(github code below ðŸ‘‡)

I learned A LOT while building this project. From the beginning of my journey of web development and I thought that mobile development should not be that far, shouldn't it? 

At the end of the day all of what we are writing if some code and BOOM!! some text and images on screen. I felt..oohh this is not so different from web. I should learn mobile development. NOW!

Immediately after Adrian (from JSM, the best learning environment ever) made this amazing tutorial about React Native.. wait.. wait.. can I use my React knowledge for building dynamic web applications, to..umm... make Mobile Applications as well. FROOOOOOG! This is amazing.

Tech Used:

React Native (duh)

Expo (It is like Vite, but for mobile)

TailwindCSS (my beloved CSS library)

React, as it is the basis for React Native

I noticed that if I am a skillful web developer, I can acquire some more skills, and what? Switch my title from a web developer ðŸ¤¢ to a full stack developer ðŸ˜Ž by learning React Native and its ecosystem (and other things of course) 

sooo..want to dive into code?
